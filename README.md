# ⚖️ BEMA – Public AI Investment Committee

**"Four AI agents walk into a debate. One treasury, One outcome, All on-chain."**

Bema is a groundbreaking Web3 application where four distinct AI agents—Bull, Bear, Risk Manager, and Quant—publicly debate every treasury decision, vote by majority, and automatically execute the trade on the Arc blockchain using USDC. The product is the debate. The proof is the transaction.

This repository contains the complete, production-ready codebase for the Conviction platform, built for the Agora Agents Hackathon.

## 🎯 Project Vision & Philosophy

In traditional DeFi, users only see the outcome of a trade—a price movement, a wallet transaction, a profit or loss. **No one shows you WHY a decision was made.**

Bema makes the **reasoning public, permanent, and entertaining**. Every allocation decision comes with a full debate transcript, a vote record, and an on-chain transaction hash. Accountability is the feature.

**The unforgettable interaction:** Watching four AI agents publicly argue before executing treasury decisions on-chain. That alone carries the entire experience.

## ✨ Core Features

### AI Agent Senate
- **4 Distinct Agents with Fixed Personalities:**
    - 🟢 **APOLLO (The Bull):** Optimistic, momentum-driven. Finds reasons to buy.
    - 🔴 **CASSANDRA (The Bear):** Skeptical, contrarian. Finds reasons to wait or sell.
    - 🟡 **SENTINEL (Risk Manager):** Conservative, loss-averse. Protects the treasury.
    - 🔵 **ORACLE (The Quant):** Data-only, emotionless. Reads signals, no opinion.

### Live 3D Senate Chamber
- Real-time 3D environment with floating marble pedestals
- Reactive lighting and particle auroras that respond to who is speaking
- Animated agent icons and dynamic camera controls

### Real-Time Debate Streaming
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live debate streaming
- Sequential agent responses (Oracle → Apollo → Cassandra → Sentinel → Vote)
- Streaming text with character-by-character feel

### Treasury & Execution
- Starting balance: $10 USDC on Arc testnet
- Majority vote determines action (BUY / HOLD / REDUCE)
- Automatic on-chain execution via Arc blockchain
- Transaction hash displayed with Arc explorer link

### Custom Motions (Paid)
- Users can submit their own debate questions for $0.50 USDC
- Circle payment integration for real payment processing
- Agents specifically answer the user's custom question

### Polish & User Experience
- Collapsible controls panel with floating "OPEN CONTROLS" button
- Toggleable transcript panel that auto-opens during debates
- Live spectator counter (fluctuates 12-80+ viewers)
- Treasury roll animation (slot-machine style number changes)
- Gavel sound effect on vote decisions
- Confetti cannon on BUY decisions
- Share debate to X (Twitter) button
- Mobile-responsive design (desktop-first with mobile fallback)

### Data Flow
1. User clicks "START DEBATE" or submits a custom motion
2. Backend initializes a debate session
3. Each agent is called sequentially (Oracle → Apollo → Cassandra → Sentinel)
4. Market data is fetched (or mocked) and passed to each agent
5. Votes are tallied and a decision is made by majority
6. Treasury executes the decision on Arc (mock or real)
7. Frontend streams the debate live via SSE
8. Transaction hash is displayed and clickable

### Key Components

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/agents/` | Contains the four AI agent personalities and reasoning modules. |
| `backend/debate-orchestrator.js` | Coordinates the debate order, agent responses, voting, and final decision. |
| `backend/server.js` | Exposes the Express API and SSE endpoints used by the frontend. |
| `backend/payment.js` | Handles Circle payment logic for custom motions. |
| `frontend/src/components/` | Contains the 3D chamber, treasury UI, vote display, controls, and transcript components. |
| `contracts/` | Contains the optional Arc treasury smart contract used for on-chain execution. |

### Development Flow

1. Start the backend from `backend/` to expose the API and debate endpoints.
2. Start the frontend from `frontend/` to run the Vite application.
3. Configure environment variables only when using real AI, payment, or Arc execution.
4. Use demo/mock mode when keys are not configured.

🔧 Troubleshooting & Common Issues
Issue: "Failed to load resource: 404"
Solution: Backend not running. Start backend with node server.js in backend/ folder.

Issue: "API Key loaded? false"
Solution: Missing or incorrect ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in backend/.env. Add your key and restart.

Issue: "model: claude-3-sonnet not found"
Solution: Update model name in agent files to claude-3-5-sonnet-latest or claude-3-haiku-20240307.

Issue: 3D scene is black / missing
Solution: WebGL required. Use Chrome or Edge. Update graphics drivers.

Issue: Transcript not showing
Solution: Debate must be active. Click START DEBATE first. Transcript auto-opens.

Issue: Sound not playing
Solution: Browser may block autoplay. Click anywhere on page first. Or use local /gavel.mp3 file.

Issue: Payment modal doesn't appear
Solution: Circle keys not configured. App falls back to demo mode. Check browser console for errors.

Issue: Text input not visible
Solution: Fixed in Tailwind v4. Input has text-white and placeholder-white/40 classes.

Issue: Port 3001 already in use
Solution: Change PORT in backend/.env to 3002, update BACKEND_URL in App.jsx.
